# Sign-Connect

**Sign-Connect** is a project designed to bridge the communication gap between the hearing and speech-impaired community and the rest of the world. The project consists of two key components:  
1. **Speech-to-Sign**: Converts spoken speech into **Indian Sign Language (ISL)**.  
2. **Sign Language Detection**: Detects hand signs representing alphabets in **Indian Sign Language** and translates them into text.
